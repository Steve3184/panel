## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v22 or higher)
    -   **Quick Node.js 22 Installation on Ubuntu/Debian**:
        ```bash
        curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | bash -
        apt install nodejs
        ```
-   Docker (Optional, for Docker instance management)
-   7-Zip (For advanced archiving operations, usually pre-installed on most systems or handled by `7zip-bin` package)

### Installation

**Recommended Installation as a systemd Service (for Linux Devices):**

For optimal operation, it is recommended to install Panel as a systemd service. This ensures it runs continuously in the background and starts automatically on system boot.

1.  **Install Node.js 22 (if not already installed):**
    ```bash
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | bash -
    sudo apt install -y nodejs
    ```

2.  **Clone the repository to `/opt/panel`:**
    ```bash
    sudo git clone https://github.com/Steve3184/panel.git /opt/panel
    cd /opt/panel
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Copy and configure the systemd service file:**
    - a.  Copy the provided `panel.service` file to the systemd directory:
        ```bash
        sudo cp panel.service /etc/systemd/system/
        ```
    - b.  Edit the service file to ensure `WorkingDirectory` and `ExecStart` point to the correct paths. Since we cloned to `/opt/panel`, the default `panel.service` should already be configured correctly. If you chose a different installation path, you would modify it as follows:
        ```
        # Example modification if your project is in /home/user/panel
        # WorkingDirectory=/home/user/panel
        # ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /home/user/panel/server.js
        ```
        **Note**: The `ExecStart` path must be the absolute path to `server.js`.

5.  **Reload systemd, enable, and start the Panel service:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable panel
    sudo systemctl start panel
    ```

6.  **Check the service status:**
    ```bash
    systemctl status panel
    ```

7.  **Initial Setup:**
    On first launch, if no admin user exists, you will be redirected to `http://localhost:3000/setup.html` to create an admin account.

### Configuration

You can configure the server language by setting the `PANEL_LANG` environment variable. For example, to set the language to Japanese:

```bash
PANEL_LANG=jp npm start
```

Supported languages are defined in the `public/lang/` directory (e.g., `en.json`, `zh_CN.json`, `jp.json`).
